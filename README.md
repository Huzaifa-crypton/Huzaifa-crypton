I am a computer science student pursuing my degree from University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. I strongly believe that, continuous learning through exploration is the key to growth and success. A person should strive to set his goals and visions in life high enough that he works tirelessly for them. As a student of knowledge, I enjoy engaging with people to share thoughts and ideas. I actively participate in student societies and volunteer in managing events and workshops. Regarding my work experience, I take immense pride of the projects I have successfully completed during my semesters. The excitement one feels when the project runs successfully is what every developer craves for. I have interest to see the working details of systems and products. This interest lead me to explore how websites are crafted and I ended up exploring website development using MEAN and MERN stacks. Other than that, I have wide range of interests too. To maintain an active lifestyle I indulge myself into sports such as badminton, cricket, football, and table tennis.
